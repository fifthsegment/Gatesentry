##### Download and Initial Setup Guide

##### Using a self-signed certificate


Even though GateSentry comes with its own certificate, for security purposes you're encouraged to generate your own. Here's how:

`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days XXX`


### Under the hood
GateSentry is powered by:
* Squid3 compiled with sslbump
* Dansguardian for http filtering 
* GateSentry's ICAP server for https filtering
* PHP5 and Sqlite powered by Laravel (for the Administration panel)

### Compiling and Running

####ICAP Server
GateSentry's source uses the Python 2.7 interpreter.

To Run:

`python icap_server.py [path of .cfg file here]`

Example:

`python icap_server.py icap_server.cfg`

#### Administration Panel

The admin panel is powered by Laravel, so you'll need a webserver to run it. On the Raspberry Pi  GateSentry uses Lighttpd to serve the administration panel.

Just provide the following path as your document Root to Lighttpd:

 `<base_path>/Gatesentry/admin_panel/site/public/`

#### Squid3 

 GateSentry uses Squid3 with -sslbump enabled. GateSentry's Squid3 config file can be found in the Squid3 labelled folder of this repo.

####Dansguardian

 Config file available in the repo. 

###Running GateSentry

Once everything is in place (Squid3, Dansguardian, GateSentry's ICAP server and the Lighttpd). Start services in the following order :

 1. Lighttpd
 2. Squid3
 3. Dansguardian
 4. GateSentry
