Branch: feature/1-device-discovery @ feb1353
Repo: myfork (jbarwick/Gatesentry)

Done:

✅ Phase 1: Device data model, store, 30 tests
✅ Phase 1: DNS handler wired — A/AAAA/PTR from device store
✅ Phase 2: Passive discovery (client IP tracking, ARP, goroutine)
✅ Pre-existing setup_test.go fix + TEST_CHANGES.md
54 tests passing (30 store + 12 passive + 12 server)
Next up (when you're back):

Phase 3: mDNS/Bonjour browser — with bridged WSL you'll actually be able to see LAN devices
Phase 4: RFC 2136 DDNS handler
Phase 5: DHCP lease reader
Phase 6: UI Devices page
Switching to bridged mode is great timing — once WSL has a real LAN IP, avahi will see actual mDNS traffic and Phase 3 becomes testable live.
